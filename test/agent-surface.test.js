// What an agent can learn about this server BEFORE it spends the caller's money.
//
// Two defect classes are pinned here, and both had already shipped once.
//
// 1. UNDISCLOSED SIDE EFFECTS. Every data tool starts a metered run on the
//    caller's own Apify account. Nothing in the tool surface said so: there
//    were no MCP annotations at all, and only run_gov_data_tool mentioned
//    billing in prose. An independent reviewer scored the surface 2/5 on
//    exactly this — "does not disclose whether the operation is read-only,
//    potentially destructive, or has side effects".
//
// 2. COUNTS WRITTEN DOWN IN PROSE. "95" shipped to npm, to Glama's meta tag,
//    and twice into the README against a live 114, plus a derived "the other
//    83". Every one of those was correct on the day it was typed. Nothing went
//    red as they rotted. A count that is not derived must not exist.
